First published in Amstrad Computer User ACU way back in [Feb 1992](https://archive.org/stream/AmstradComputerUser200786/AmstradComputerUser/AmstradComputerUser87-0292#page/n15/mode/1up) when we used to use :floppy_disk: to store and share stuff.

So this isn't exciting in itself except to say that the pinnacle of my childhood computing has been preserved by the internet. That this can now be run-up in a web browser easily emulating the peak of home technology from my youth.

So what does this mean for the next generation ... I think of all the kit in their young lives and massive amount of access to compute processing power that they have now. I think of massive efforts world-wide to get more and more of us online and connected. Changes in technology every ten years of my life whose impacts continue to take me by surprise. The future will truely be furteristic :bangbang:
