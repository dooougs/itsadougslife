Build a blog for free.

A free blog is doable if you work in IT, otherwise just pay someone to do it. 

This blog has three parts: the storage is on [GitHub](github.com); the framework is [Hugo](gohugo.io); and the deploy engine is [CircleCI](circleci.com).

These were just the best fit at the time, free and simple. This simplicity does mean limited functionality but the remit was just a basic blog so this isn’t an issue. This simplicity also means simple to use, any text editor on any device to creat a post and then stick a copy onto github and you’re published. 

Check the [repo](https://github.com/dooougs/itsadougslife) for this blog to see an example.
