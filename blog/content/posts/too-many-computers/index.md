too many computers

Every time I find a few spare minutes to haxor the codes I grab the closest computer, the one not being used by other family members, and GO!

For me this is a relatively new phenomenon brought about by my adoption of, initially npm and now yarn and using all the open source code there is. I’ve also had to give up expectations of “proper” debugging and IDE support tools. Like a lot of the world I’ve also adopted VSCode.

 … as a previous Microsoft hater this seems weird and unlikely but, Windows OS aside, NEW Microsoft is not the crazy evil of old. As long as you pay for Azure or make something that will encourage someone else to end up paying for Azure time then they are your best friends [don’t begrudge them they are a business].

So,VSCode, yarn and react? react-native? dotnet-core? well, it all installs and runs everywhere.

WooHoo … except.

I HAVE TOO MANY COMPUTERS :astonished:

Every time I find a few spare minutes to haxor I find my chosen device is 5 major versions out of date for pretty much everything and the first 20mins is spent downloading updates. 

I am considering just setting up a dev VM (or two) in the cloud so I can just jump to it from the ‘closest computer’ … does that mean I’m gonna end up paying Microsoft for Azure or Amazon for AWS for VM time … sigh!
